Programming Project 1: Lexical Analysis
---------------------------------------

In the first programming project, you will get your compiler off to a great
start by implementing the lexical analyzer. For the first task of the
front-end, you will use flex to create a scanner for the Decaf programming
language. Your scanner will transform the source file from a stream of bits and
bytes into a series of meaningful tokens containing information that will be
used by the later stages of the compiler.
